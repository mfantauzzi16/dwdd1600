        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>What is vinyl?</h2>
        <p>Vinyl is the material the record is made of. And before vinyl was shellac and before shellac were gigantic
            cylinders made of zinc and glass. Vinyl is a synthetic plastic called polyvinyl chloride. It is made from
            ethylene (crude oil) and chlorine, and its creation was part of the plastics boom in the early 1900s.
            Material scientists were constantly innovating with these synthetic polymers that seemed to outperform wood,
            stone, leather, ceramic, metal, and glass in various respects.</p>

        <h2>Vinyl Speeds</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>78 rpm</dt>
            <dd>This was the classic speed. It was generated based on the modern engine of the time. Large 3600 rpm
                engines would operate with 46-teeth gears. As the shellac records were mass-produced, these engines
                would run at a speed of 3600 divided by 46, or roughly 78.2 rpm. Thus, this was the speed it needed to
                be played to hear the audio appropriately.</dd>

            <dt>45 rpm</dt>
            <dd>Less than a year after the 33 rpm record was announced, the 45 rpm 7-inch record was released by RCA
                Victor—Columbia Record’s primary competitor. The two record speeds quickly overtook the market. 33 rpm
                records became known as LPs (or long plays), and 45 rpm took over the EP market (or extended play)—which
                was generally when a band would put out a single or dual track.</dd>

            <dt>33 1/3 rpm</dt>
            <dd> Most records that you see today are 33 1/3 rpm LPs. While 45s and 33s held stakes over different areas
                of the music industry, 33s were the true successor of the form. Still collected, bought and sold today,
                LPs are regarded as a window into the past. A reflection of a different time. And its sound quality,
                though imperfect, is preferred by many, even today.</dd>

        <h2>9 Types of Vinyl Records to Know</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>12-Inch Albums (LP or Long-Playing)<br>
            The LP, or "long play," is the backbone of the vinyl world. These 12-inch records, spinning at 33 1/3 RPM, can hold about 22 minutes of music on each side. They revolutionized the music industry by allowing artists to create cohesive, thematic albums. But what about EPs? The "extended play" is somewhat of a middle ground. They're often the same size as LPs but contain more music than a single, yet less than an album, offering listeners a more extended experience than a single but a shorter one than an LP. Skipping record issues, though rare, can sometimes affect these formats, but they're typically easy to resolve.</li>
            <li>Extended Play Vinyl Records (EP)<br>
            EPs are the unsung heroes of the vinyl family. Typically containing 3-5 tracks, they're perfect for artists to release music without the commitment of a full-length album. For listeners, EPs offer a snapshot of an artist's work, often showcasing versatility and experimentation. They bridge the gap between a single and an album, providing a more extended experience than a single but a shorter one than an LP. They've been instrumental in introducing new artists or giving established ones a platform for experimentation.</li>
            <li>7-Inch Singles<br>
            The 7-inch single, often spinning at 45 RPM, is a brief musical affair. With just one song on each side, they were the darlings of jukeboxes and radio stations, offering listeners a quick taste of an artist's latest hit. These records have been pivotal in shaping pop culture, often being the medium for chart-topping hits. Their compact nature and affordability made them a favorite among music lovers.</li>
            <li>12-Inch Singles<br>
            These are the lifeblood of the club scene. With extended or remixed versions of songs, they're perfect for dancing. Their wider grooves provide better sound quality, making them a favorite among DJs. These records have played a significant role in the evolution of dance music, giving DJs the flexibility to weave different tracks seamlessly.</li>
            <li>10-Inch Records<br>
            These records, often spinning at 33 1/3 RPM or sometimes 78 RPM, are a versatile bunch. They've been used for everything from special releases to certain classical music recordings, offering listeners a different experience. Being one of the more unique vinyl record sizes, they're often the choice for limited edition releases or niche recordings.</li>
            <li>78s (Mostly Shellac Records)<br>
            Before the dominance of vinyl, there were 78s. Made mostly of shellac, these records have a rich history, dating back to the early 20th century. Their brittle nature means few have survived in good condition, making them a collector's dream. These records are a window into a bygone era, capturing the sounds and styles of their time. They're a testament to the ever-evolving nature of music recording and consumption.</li>
            <li>Flexi Discs<br>
            These are the wild cards of the vinyl world. Thin, flexible, and often used for promotional purposes, they've been found in magazines or as bonuses with other records. Their unconventional nature made them perfect for unique marketing campaigns or as collectible novelties. While not known for their longevity or high-fidelity sound, they hold a special place in the hearts of many collectors for their novelty and the innovative ways they were distributed.</li>
            <li>Colored Vinyl Records<br>
            Who said vinyl has to be black? Colored vinyl records, from translucent hues to vibrant solids, are a visual treat. They've become particularly popular for special editions or collector's items. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, colored vinyl records often represent limited editions or special releases, making them highly sought after by collectors. They add a touch of flair and personality to any vinyl collection.</li>
            <li>Dubplates<br>
            These are the unicorns of the vinyl world. Often used by DJs and producers, they're unique records pressed for personal use. They're not designed for longevity, making them rare and sought after. Dubplates have deep roots in reggae and dancehall culture, where they were used to test new tracks in clubs before official release. They represent a raw, unfiltered version of a track, often with alternate mixes or versions not found anywhere else.</li>

        <h2>The Downfall of Vinyl Records</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In 1982, the Sony Corporation created the first compact disc, and things weren't looking good for
                    vinyl. CDs were small, portable, and reliable, and they could be played using a device that could
                    travel anywhere. Cars started being manufactured with built-in CD and cassette players, and the
                    public eye shifted over quickly to this new format. It was looking like vinyl would become
                    completely obsolete.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Comeback of Vinyl Records</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Eventually, it was the CD that fell out of style - and vinyl that rose to the top once again. In the
                    last decade, there's been a significant decline in the sales of physical media as a whole - DVDs,
                    CDs, and more. All of these formats have been overtaken by streaming services and digital media, but
                    records are still standing tall.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Vinyl sales have increased over the last decade, with many millennials and gen-Zers discovering the
                    appeal of warm, analog sound. Just about every major-label artist, and a wide array of independent
                    bands and musicians, are releasing their newest records on vinyl these days. The format has made a
                    historic comeback, had a massive cultural impact, and shifted the tide of the music industry forever
                    - and it's over a century old.</p>
            </li>
