        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>What is vinyl?</h2>
        <p>Vinyl is the material the record is made of. And before vinyl was shellac and before shellac were gigantic
            cylinders made of zinc and glass. Vinyl is a synthetic plastic called polyvinyl chloride. It is made from
            ethylene (crude oil) and chlorine, and its creation was part of the plastics boom in the early 1900s.
            Material scientists were constantly innovating with these synthetic polymers that seemed to outperform wood,
            stone, leather, ceramic, metal, and glass in various respects.</p>

        <h2>Vinyl Speeds</h2>
        <ol>
            <dl>
            <li><dt>78 rpm</dt>
            <dd>This was the classic speed. It was generated based on the modern engine of the time. Large 3600 rpm
                engines would operate with 46-teeth gears. As the shellac records were mass-produced, these engines
                would run at a speed of 3600 divided by 46, or roughly 78.2 rpm. Thus, this was the speed it needed to
                be played to hear the audio appropriately.</dd></li>

            <li><dt>45 rpm</dt>
            <dd>Less than a year after the 33 rpm record was announced, the 45 rpm 7-inch record was released by RCA
                Victor—Columbia Record’s primary competitor. The two record speeds quickly overtook the market. 33 rpm
                records became known as LPs (or long plays), and 45 rpm took over the EP market (or extended play)—which
                was generally when a band would put out a single or dual track.</dd></li>

            <li><dt>33 1/3 rpm</dt>
            <dd> Most records that you see today are 33 1/3 rpm LPs. While 45s and 33s held stakes over different areas
                of the music industry, 33s were the true successor of the form. Still collected, bought and sold today,
                LPs are regarded as a window into the past. A reflection of a different time. And its sound quality,
                though imperfect, is preferred by many, even today.</dd></li>

        <h2>The Downfall of Vinyl Records</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In 1982, the Sony Corporation created the first compact disc, and things weren't looking good for
                    vinyl. CDs were small, portable, and reliable, and they could be played using a device that could
                    travel anywhere. Cars started being manufactured with built-in CD and cassette players, and the
                    public eye shifted over quickly to this new format. It was looking like vinyl would become
                    completely obsolete.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Comeback of Vinyl Records</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Eventually, it was the CD that fell out of style - and vinyl that rose to the top once again. In the
                    last decade, there's been a significant decline in the sales of physical media as a whole - DVDs,
                    CDs, and more. All of these formats have been overtaken by streaming services and digital media, but
                    records are still standing tall.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Vinyl sales have increased over the last decade, with many millennials and gen-Zers discovering the
                    appeal of warm, analog sound. Just about every major-label artist, and a wide array of independent
                    bands and musicians, are releasing their newest records on vinyl these days. The format has made a
                    historic comeback, had a massive cultural impact, and shifted the tide of the music industry forever
                    - and it's over a century old.</p>
