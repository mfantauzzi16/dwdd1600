        <h1>Who Were the Signers</h1>
        <h2>Famous Signers</h2>
        <p>The Declaration of Independence, signed on July 4, 1776, had 56 signers, but some of the most famous ones are
            often highlighted because of their significant roles in American history or their later contributions to the
            nation. Here are a few of the most well-known:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Thomas Jefferson</dt>
            <dd>Primary author of the Declaration of Independence. Later became the third president of the United States
                and played a key role in founding the University of Virginia.</dd>

            <dt>John Adams</dt>
            <dd>A strong advocate for independence and a member of the committee that drafted the Declaration. Later

            <dd>A leading figure in the Continental Congress and a key negotiator in the American Revolution. Became one
                of the Founding Fathers and served as U.S. Ambassador to France.</dd>

            <dt>John Hancock</dt>
            <dd>President of the Continental Congress and the first person to sign the Declaration (famously with a
                large, bold signature). Later became governor of Massachusetts.</dd>

            <dt>Samuel Adams</dt>
            <dd>A key leader of the American Revolution and a founding member of the Sons of Liberty. Later served as

                senator from Virginia and an influential voice in the early Republic.</dd>

            <dt>James Madison</dt>
            <dd>Although he didn't sign the Declaration, Madison played a key role in drafting the U.S. Constitution.

            <dt>Thomas Paine</dt>
            <dd>Although not a signer, Paine's pamphlet *Common Sense* heavily influenced public opinion in favor of
                independence. He continued writing influential works, such as *The American Crisis*, during the
                Revolution.</dd>
        </dl>


        <p>These individuals are some of the most famous names, but the document itself is a product of collective
            effort from many statesmen. The Declaration of Independence itself, and those who signed it, played a
            pivotal role in establishing the United States as an independent nation.</p>
